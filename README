What do you need to start with this project:
  * Eclipse indigo
  * ADT
  * Android SDK (now I'm using 2.3 SDK)
  * Obviously git (I suggest use the eclipse plugin -eGit-)

Use the whole workspace as the root of the git (in other words, if you have download the whole git project on your local repo, on /home/userName/KidsGame that must be your eclipse workspace)

Hope this helps
